# Simplex-Method-with-Java
Java does the Simplex Method for you. Printing each step for your understanding.

Everything is on cmd, and I've tried to make it as readable as possible...

If you get the array out of index error it means none of the min pos ratios are positive.
Wait I'll add that later.

Also I've kinda made the loop go only till a max of 10 matrices. You can change that easily. Just ctrl + f on your editor and type in loop.
You should be able to see a for loop. Change 10 to whatever number you want to, to change the max number of times you want the loop to run.
